				I am a second-year student looking for an internship to gain my first experience in the IT industry. I am
				willing to develop my interests in the fields of data analysis and artificial intelligence. In my opinion
				socializing, building relationships and getting into teams quickly are essential to become a good teammate.
				Currently, in my spare time, I am expanding my knowledge in the fields of statistics, databases and programming.
